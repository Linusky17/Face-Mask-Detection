# Face-Mask-Detection

This is the final project of the Birds Team for ML4VA. In this project, we used transfer learning on resnet50 to build a Machine Learning model that can predict if people in a photo are wearing their masks with 97% accuracy. The model will identify each person in the photo and whether or not they are wearing a mask.
